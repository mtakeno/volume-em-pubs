# volume-em-pubs
Interactive graph of publications of large-volume dense EM reconstruction volumes vs. time.

This started as a personal toy project to learn interactive graphing in Python and Bokeh.

Initial idea and data from Timothy Lee, Georgia Institute of Technology.

Files in /example are derived from Tim's data.

Roadmap:
- add logic to determine if point is graphed (conditional on is_plotted)
- add year and author as separate tags in hover box
